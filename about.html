<h1>About Me</h1>
<p style="font-size: large; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am so happy now that I see myself as a trillionaire and the head and owner of the biggest tech company and the largest group of companies in the world. 
  I am living the life I always aimed for when I was a kid. I used to live in a house of rent, now I have my own Penthouse, a big one. 
  I still wear casual clothes mostly but I do have expensive suits which I wear during business meetings and formal parties. 
  I now have 3 cars, an Audi R8, an Audi RS e-tron and a Rolls Royce. Recently I also bought a Rolex watch made entirely of Gold. 
  It is funny that now I can easily buy dozens of them, but earlier I could barely afford one. 
  Now my life is full of peace, joy and fun. My family consists of my mother, who has supported me in the toughest times of my life, 
  my wife who is the love of my life and she has loved me and cared for me and stood by me in all situations, and my kids who are twins, one boy and one girl. 
  They are my sweet angels but really naughty. I also have 2 golden retrievers, one male and one female. 
  A typical day in my life is like this, I wake up usually at 6 in the morning, brush my teeth and wash my face, and then I go for a 10km run in the complex of my society. 
  After running, I spend some time in my gym room, where I workout. I usually do calisthenic workout with minimum weight lifting. Then around 7:30, I see off my kids going to school, then I go for a swim in my swimming pool. 
  After that, I have a nice and relaxing bath and then I have my breakfast. We have servants, but still my wife cooks because she loves to cook for me.
  After having breakfast I kiss my wife and hug my mom, then leave for work. I usually spend 2 to 3 hours at work, sometimes even 4 hours, which mostly consists of meetings, presentations by juniors regarding projects and reading/replying to emails. 
  I reach office typically by 9:30, and by 12:30 I am done. Then I go back home, have lunch with family and collect the kids from school. Then I spend some time playing with the kids and also helping them with their homework. 
  When they go out to play with their friends in evening, I finally relax with my wife. At 5, we all have tea and talk about random stuff. At 7, we have dinner and by 10 pm, we go to sleep. 
  The best thing about my life is that it is so peaceful and it has no issues anywhere. Everything is balanced and the way I need it to be.</p>
